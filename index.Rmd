## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to how politicians trend on social media (measured through hashtags or the frequency of their name in a post/tweet/etc) and how that correlates with their popularity ratings at the time.

Alternatively, I'm also thinking about looking at the frequency of migration news articles in the media and how the increase/decrease of media attention correlates with negative/positive public opinion on migration. A problem I see with this is that the public opinion on migration might not be surveyed frequently enough to be able to examine any connection with the increase/decrease of media articles. Potentially I could just conduct this at a broader scale and look at this yearly and see if, in a year with high media attention on migration, there was a significant increase/decrease in positive/negative public opinion.
